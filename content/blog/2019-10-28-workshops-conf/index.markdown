rstudio::conf(2020) is fast approaching, and in addition to the many fantastic 
talks lined up for the conference, we're very much looking forward to the Training 
Days, which will feature a whopping 19 2-day workshops!

Below is a closer look at each of these workshops. We hope that this information 
can help you decide which one to attend. It's a tough decision!
